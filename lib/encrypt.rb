# Write a Ruby program that can just output a string like:

# $ ruby ./lib/encrypt.rb message.txt encrypted.txt
# Created 'encrypted.txt' with the key 82648 and date 030415

# Then work to:

# Pull the specified output filename from the command line arguments and put it into the string output
# Get today's date, format it, and output it in the string
# Generate a random number as the key and output it in the string
